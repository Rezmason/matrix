  Figure out texture pyramid stuff
    Idea: use mip levels to store stuff
      Multiple draw calls, if level N must downsample level N - 1
    Does every level HAVE to be downsampled from the previous level? Or can they all be downsampled from a single source?
      What about in my case in particular? I'm blurring everything anyway.

  blur pass
  Switch to rgba32float somehow?
    Why isn't this straightforward?
  Update links in issues
  Get rid of end pass once it's possible to copy a bgra8unorm to a canvas texture

Support looping

Write an explanation of the rain pass (and include images)
  Compute
  Volumetric quads
  Fullscreen quad and spacial mapping
  MSDFs

gpu-buffer, working title
  Try and use it for the palette color buffer
  Test it
  Demo it to others
  Make improvements
  Capture expected requirements down the road, make roadmap
  License it and put it somewhere else

Resurrection
  Modified glyph order?
  New glyphs?
    Good luck with that, champ

  Use WebAudio to mess with it

Idea: Build a UI
  Changes some uniforms
  Effect selection would swap out the desired effect pass, somehow
  The color palette stuff would be hard


Experiment with varying the colors in the palette pass
  Maybe a separate palette for the non-bloom
  Maybe dim and widen the bloom
  Just make sure the changes to non-default configurations are acceptable

  Maybe try and accomplish the effect in Photoshop, to get a sense of what's going on

Deja vu effect: flashing rows
  Make them flash all the time
  Then use a thunder-like pattern to show and hide the flash

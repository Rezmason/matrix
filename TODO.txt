Reach out to Ashley's partner about producing sounds
  Raindrop sound

    https://youtu.be/h1vLZeVAp5o?t=28
  Flashing row sound
    https://youtu.be/z_KmNZNT5xw?t=16
  Square sound
    https://youtu.be/ngnlBZNuVb8?t=204
    https://youtu.be/721sG2D_9-U?t=67

Much later:
  Deluxe compute variables
    Flashing row effect
    Square event
      Expanding white outline of a box
      Delay it like the raindrop particles
  Simpler bloom replacement?
  More patterns?
    Symbol duplication is common

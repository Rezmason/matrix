TODO:

Seems like bloom size and resolution impact the REGL and WebGPU bloom implementations differently
  Move high pass into WebGPU bloom

Live config update roadmap

Write an explanation of the rain pass (and include images)
  Compute
  Volumetric quads
  Fullscreen quad and spacial mapping
  MSDFs

Audio system
  Toggle (or number representing frequency)
  Load the sound effect
  Play it multiple times with delay
    Random pan
    Random volume?
    Randomize pitch a little?

Playdate version
  Audio system
    Falling sound
    Launch sound
    Undocking sound
    Docking sound
    Maybe crank sounds? Not sure yet

Support Resurrections SDF bevel and "lights"
  https://shaderfun.com/2018/07/23/signed-distance-fields-part-8-gradients-bevels-and-noise/
  Get the "normals" and color right
    Note: even completely dark glyphs can have glint on their edges
    "Golden hour"
  Stuff MSDF-derived normal vectors from rain pass frag into two of its output channels
  Anomaly mode toggles between this and anomaly streaks

WebGPU
  Try https://github.com/brendan-duncan/wgsl_reflect
  Get rid of end pass once it's possible to copy a bgra8unorm to a canvas texture
  Switch to rgba32float somehow?
    Why isn't this straightforward?
  Try shorthand
  Share a bind group and layout just for time?
  Try using a buffer for the stripe pass 1D texture

Improve loop support

Idea: Build a UI
  Replace versions with presets
  Simple changes update the values
  Complex changes replace the pipeline
  Make it a form, so it's accessible
  Then, make it look cool like the UI from the old site

Maybe pay someone to make Mac/Windows screensavers

Zion Control's matrix variant
  From Reloaded

gpu-buffer, working title
  Support type aliasing (type Q = array<i32, 5>)
  Support shorthand (vec4f)
  Build mocha tests, example project
  Give it its own repo, microsite

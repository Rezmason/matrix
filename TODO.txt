  Rename setSize to rebuild — it is the function that receives inputs as well as screen size
  Create and store the bloom bind groups on resize
  Make sure everything is properly commented

  Get rid of end pass once it's possible to copy a bgra8unorm to a canvas texture
  Switch to rgba32float somehow?
    Why isn't this straightforward?

Support looping

  New glyphs?
    Good luck with that, champ

  Use WebAudio to mess with it

Idea: Build a UI
  Changes some uniforms
  Effect selection would swap out the desired effect pass, somehow
  The color palette stuff would be hard


Experiment with varying the colors in the palette pass
  Maybe a separate palette for the non-bloom
  Maybe dim and widen the bloom
  Just make sure the changes to non-default configurations are acceptable

  Maybe try and accomplish the effect in Photoshop, to get a sense of what's going on

Deja vu effect: flashing rows
  Make them flash all the time
  Then use a thunder-like pattern to show and hide the flash

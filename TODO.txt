  blur pass

  Update links in issues

  Try to change post processing to compute shaders once they're easier to support

  gpu-uniforms
    Is this an adequate name for it? Can't it be useful for non-uniform-related things?
      gpu-buffer maybe?
    Resolve the remaining to-dos
    Try and use it for the palette color buffer
    Test it
    Demo it to others
    Make improvements
    License it and put it somewhere else


Write an explanation of the rain pass (and include images)
  Compute
  Volumetric quads
  Fullscreen quad and spacial mapping
  MSDFs

Support looping

Resurrection
  Modified glyph order?
  New glyphs?
    Good luck with that, champ

Audio
  Synthesize raindrop sound
  Use WebAudio to mess with it

Idea: Build a UI
  Changes some uniforms
  Effect selection would swap out the desired effect pass, somehow
  The color palette stuff would be hard


Experiment with varying the colors in the palette pass
  Maybe a separate palette for the non-bloom
  Maybe dim and widen the bloom
  Just make sure the changes to non-default configurations are acceptable

  Maybe try and accomplish the effect in Photoshop, to get a sense of what's going on

Deja vu effect: flashing rows
  Make them flash all the time
  Then use a thunder-like pattern to show and hide the flash
